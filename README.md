# How to Start on Pizza Game

P2E (Play-to-Earn) is a rapidly growing subsection of the cryptocurrency landscape. There is so much opportunity to navigate through that sometimes you can get caught up in the weeds pretty quickly. That’s why I’m breaking down how to get started with one of my favorite P2Es, Pizza Game.

Pizza Game is a web-based idle game on the [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) Blockchain where you are the owner of a digital pizzeria! The user obtains Chefs ([ERC-721](https://decrypt.co/resources/erc-721-ethereum-nft-token-standard) NFTs)  or Master Chefs (powered-up Chef) to work and create $PIZZA (an [ERC-20](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-erc-20-gas-ether-ethereum) token) as long as they are staked in your pizzeria. The goal here is to collect NFTs to upgrade your pizzeria’s $PIZZA production and “dominate” the Pizza Industry! The developers continually add new scenarios and tools that tweak the game’s mechanics to ever so slightly change the [meta](https://dotesports.com/general/news/what-is-the-meta-meaning-24834) while maintaining balance to the game’s economy.

Interested? Let’s go through what to expect when you first reach 
the [homepage](https://pizza.game/).

You’ll be met with the Pizza Game logo (an homage to classic era video games of the 80’s) and a welcome screen that displays a few tidbits of information about the status of the game:

- The amount of NFTs sold
- Statistics of minting a Master Chef (more on this later)
- All the $PIZZA tokens used for minting will be burned
- And basic instructions of the 10 Chef limit for your pizzeria (more on this later)

Below this section you will find 3 buttons. One labeled "Pizza Game" to enter the application, along with [Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.pizza.game/) and [Docs](https://pizza.game/docs) to review the documentation. Docs are updated periodically with each new update. It’s best to check in here to review any changes made. The developer team and community respond promptly if you have any questions.

All 20,000 Chefs have been sold out. The only way to purchase a Chef now is through the open market ([NFTrade](https://nftrade.com/)). On the right side of the welcome section you will find buttons that take you directly to the marketplace to purchase Chefs and/or Tools (ERC-721 NFT). Chefs can use Tools to produce a higher amount of $PIZZA per minute or PPM. Tools cannot be used if there is no Chef to wield it.

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pizzagame) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PizzadotGame) links on the bottom along with links to all their contract addresses via [Snowtrace](https://snowtrace.io/) ([Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) of Avalanche)
You don’t need a Chef to play but to keep it simple, let’s assume you bought a Chef and a Tool and you’re ready to start playing. Click the Pizza Game button and let’s begin!

### Pizzeria

The Pizza Game app starts off in the pizzeria where you're greeted with big, retro-styled digits along with stats of your operation. Below you'll see 2 empty boxes with a stake button. This is where you will stake your Chefs and Tools. There are 4 tabs above the boxes labeled:
- Staked
	- Shows your current amount of staked Chefs and Tools.
- Unstaked
	- Shows any Chefs or Tools in your wallet not being used.
- Resting
	- When you unstake your Chefs from the pizzeria, they will need to rest from working hard. (6 hours for Chefs and 3 hours for Master Chefs) 
- Skill tree
	- Enables special power-ups to your pizzeria for a price.
	- Requires a deposit of $SODA (More on this later)

**Notice** - There is a small glass to the right of the claim button. That is an espresso shot. Your Chefs get fatigued as they produce $PIZZA. The higher the PPM, the faster your Chefs tire out, causing a decrease in PPM. At 100% your Chefs will no longer produce $PIZZA. You'll need an espresso shot to revive them.
	
Stake your Chefs and Tools and you will notice your pizza counter has begun. Congratulations! You're making that sweet pizza! Let's go over another important component while that's going, Soda Station.

<img width="900" alt="PizzaDotGame Soda Station" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17716182/171507144-44411668-37b5-4d60-865f-e94e3cf1bb0e.png">

### Soda Station

$SODA is the second coin produced from Pizza Game. You can purchase it from trading $PIZZA to $SODA or you can produce it in the Soda Station. The display is similar to the Pizzeria with $SODA being the coin produced. Instead of staking tools you will need to stake Cups. The mechanics are a little more complex here but here's how cups work:
- Cups can be created by combining a Tool from the pizzeria and an amount of $PIZZA-AVAX LP (LP's are a more advanced [topic](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/liquidity-provider-tokens-lp-tokens))
- The Cups themselves can be staked as long as there's a Chef to hold it.
- Cups are ***not*** NFTs and are tied to your Soda Station like skill tree points.

The Refrigerator is a way you can stake your $SODA. Every time someone claims their $SODA from the Soda Station there is a 10% tax that is paid and staked into the Refrigerator. Your stake will get auto-compounded as more people pay the tax. You can unstake your $SODA with 2 options:
- Wait 2 days for your $SODA to "defrost". 10% of your claim will be burned.
- Unstake immediately. 25% of your claim will be burned.

### Staking

The 3rd tab, **Staking**, shows a few other options you have to stake your tokens.
- Pizza Bank
	- Stake your $PIZZA to earn $WAVAX
- Soda Bank
	- Stake your $SODA to earn $WAVAX
- Freezer
	- Stake your $PIZZA and earn a cut of the taxes when users claim their $PIZZA (Like the Refrigerator)
- Soda Fountain
	-  Stake your $PIZZA-$AVAX LP to earn $SODA


***NOTE*** - The staking page is currently in the process of being reworked and will be updated in the next update. I ***highly*** encourage you to read the [Docs](https://pizza.game/docs) and check into the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pizzagame) to ask the community any questions you may have.

***NOTE*** - The last tab **Mafia Boss** is being removed in the next update and will not affect your gameplay.


There are multiple strategies that Pizza Game allows the user to play which cultivates a unique sandbox-like style of gameplay. Users not only control their assets, but control their experience, play-style, and **income**, much similarly to how you would owning a pizzeria IRL *(In Real Life)*

I hope this gives you a solid baseline of the game to get started! See ya in the metaverse✌️
